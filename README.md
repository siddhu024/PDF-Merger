This project is a simple Python program that lets you merge multiple PDF files into one single PDF.
You just enter how many PDFs you want to merge, type their file names, and the script combines them into a new file called: mergered-pdfs.pdf

*Features:
1. Merge any number of PDF files
2. Easy to use from the terminal
3. Uses the PyPDF2 library

*How It Works
1. The program asks how many PDFs you want to merge
2. You enter the names of the files (in the same folder as the script)
3. A new merged PDF is created automatically

*Requirements
Make sure you have PyPDF2 installed: pip install PyPDF2

*How to Run
1. Place all the PDFs in the same directory as the script
2. Run the program: python main.py
3. Follow the instructions in the terminal
